🐍 Reinforcement Learning Snake Agent
University Project — Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to Snake

This repository contains a Reinforcement Learning agent trained to play the classic Snake game using Deep Q‑Learning. The project includes the game environment, the neural network model, training logs, performance metrics, and visualizations.

🎯 Project Goals
Build a functional Snake environment.

Implement a Deep Q‑Learning agent.

Train and evaluate different neural network architectures.

Visualize learning progress and compare performance across models.

🧠 Methodology
The agent is based on:

Deep Q‑Learning (DQN)

A fully connected neural network as the Q‑function approximator

Replay Buffer for stable learning

Reward shaping based on survival and food collection

Iterative training with performance tracking
